- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Check `requirements.txt` for the full list of dependencies.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamuelTD/Brief_Churn_Rate_DeepLearning.git
   cd Brief_Churn_Rate_Deeplearning
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data
This project uses a dataset detailing an american telecom client base. The goal of the project is to train a model that is capable of predicting if a given customer is at risk of breaking their contract with the company (churn).

The dataset can be downloaded here :
